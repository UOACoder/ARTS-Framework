## 🧩 Abstract

**ARTS (Automated Reasoning Testbed Synthesizer)** is a framework designed to evaluate the true logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike static benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K) that suffer from data contamination, ARTS generates **dynamic, contamination-free reasoning tasks** on the fly.

Key innovations include:
1.  **Formal Verification**: Integrated **Z3 SMT Solver** ensures every generated case is mathematically well-posed and solvable.
2.  **Cognitive Scaffolding**: Deconstructs complex reasoning into hierarchical layers to diagnose specific cognitive failures.
3.  **Infinite Evaluation**: Capable of synthesizing infinite unique test cases to prevent memorization.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The framework consists of a generator pipeline, a symbolic verification engine, and an evaluation harness.

## ⚡ Quick Start

You can run the standalone demonstration script to see the model interface and verification logic in action.

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YaboWangCS/ARTS-Framework.git
cd ARTS-Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Setup API Keys

Copy the example environment file and add your API keys (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific keys
```

### 3. Run the Demo

This script demonstrates loading a model, processing a recursive reasoning task, and parsing the output.
```bash
python demo.py
```
